title: "Spatial organization in ciliary arrays"
summary: "*In vivo* the spatial organization of multiciliated cells and tissues is subject to several constraints. For instance, multiciliated tissues need to accomodate a variety of cell types, leading to  areas devoid of cilia activity along a tissue. Furthermore, cilia must orient relative to each other within each cell and across the plane of the epithelium. 

Using a combination of live microscopy, molecular perturbations and quantitative image analysis we study how changes to the spatial organization of a ciliary array impacts the topology of the flows generated by it. We explore this question using the airway epithelium and multiciliated unicellular protists as models."
