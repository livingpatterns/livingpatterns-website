I am currently planning to major in Biology with a minor in Hispanic Studies. I am interested in further understanding how specific properties of cilia influence the phenotypes of ciliary arrays and the role that those properties play in various large scale human mechanisms and functions.
On-campus, I am a Peer Mentor for first-year students through the Student Support Services Program and a part of the Brandeis Asian American Students Association E-Board. In my spare time, I like to crochet/knit, learn languages, cook, and explore new restaurants!
