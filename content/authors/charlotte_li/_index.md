I am currently planning to major in Biology. I’m excited to work in the Living Patterns Lab because I value this lab’s active work in researching more about cell and developmental biology. I hope to develop my quantitative skills, especially writing software for instruments, writing image analysis routines as well as a better understanding of the biophysical mechanisms that link cytoskeletal pattering, ciliary organization and flow generation. I am on the Women’s soccer team & a member of the Student Union, serving as Senator at Large. I am also a new analyst for the Investment Club, a member of Companions to Elders, & a volunteer at Healthy Waltham. When I’m not in the lab, I enjoy farming, baking, & playing with my cat.
