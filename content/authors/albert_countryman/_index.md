I'm planning on majoring in Physics! With regards to the Living Pattern Lab's work, I'm interested in studying the physics of fluid flows generated on the strange scale of cells, with particular focus on how the characteristics of metachronal waves generated by cilia assist with transport. In a more general sense, I love any opportunity to work on interdisciplinary projects that expose all involved to new ways of thinking about problems. Outside of work and school, I love to draw and animate!
