I studied Physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City. As an undergraduate, I worked on understanding the gating kinetics of voltage gated ion channels. During this time I became interested in research at the interface of Physics and Biology and thus decided to pursue a PhD in an interdisciplinary field.

I earned my PhD in Biophysics under the supervision of Margaret Gardel at the University of Chicago. My work in the Gardel lab focused on understanding how cell migration is guided by the geometry of the extra-cellular environment. Additionally, during my doctoral studies I collaborated closely with the Horne-Badovinac lab to investigate the role of cytoskeletal patterning in organ morphogenesis.

The experience of collaborating across different fields inspired me to become a joint postdoctoral researcher with Wallace Marshall at the University of California, San Francisco and Manu Prakash at Stanford University. Here I became interested in combining tools from cell biology and fluid mechanics to study flow generation by ciliary arrays.

I will start my lab in the fall of 2020 at Brandeis University. Research in my lab will focus in identifying the key physical properties of individual cilia that control the emergent phenotypes of a ciliary array and the flow generated.
