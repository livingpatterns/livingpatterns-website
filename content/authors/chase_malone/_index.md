Currently, I plan to double major in Biology and HSSP. One of my many goals is 
to gain more experience doing research. In high school, I did 4 years of 
research locating the off-target locations for skin cell defense enzyme genes. 
I am a part of the track team and an active member of Brandeis Black Student 
Organization. A few pastimes of mine are running, traveling, meeting new people 
and hanging out with friends!
