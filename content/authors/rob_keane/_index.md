I am pursuing my PhD in Physics at Brandeis University. I studied Physics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. As an undergraduate, I worked in the Dinsmore lab where I studied the physical principles underlying soft materials such as membranes, fluid interfaces, colloids, emulsions, and powders. I worked on a project focused on the adsorption of anionic nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces driven by ion partitioning. Additionally, I also investigated the interactions and morphologies which form between ultrathin self-assembling sheets when added to lipid bilayer vesicles in suspension. 

During my undergraduate career, I was also fortunate to be a part of two summer REU programs. As a member of the Brandeis MRSEC 2018 REU, I worked in the Dogic lab where I studied the network mechanics of F-actin microstructures. In the 2019, I worked in the Paulsen Lab where I studied the mechanics of thin floating sheets under lateral forcing as a part of the Syracuse Biomaterials Institute REU.

I am fascinated by interdisciplinary science which lies at the interface between biology and physics. I am studying the collective dynamics and behaviors of multiciliated cells and cilia and how they work to generate flows and living patterns. My work combines aspects of cell biology, active matter, and fluid mechanics. Outside of lab, you can find me reading or spending time outdoors.
