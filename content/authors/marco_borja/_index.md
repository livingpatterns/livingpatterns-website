I am currently on track to obtain a major in Physics and a minor in Computer Science. I'm really excited to be working at the Living Patterns Lab because I've recently just learned how much there is still yet to know about the inner workings of basic cell structures such as cilia and flagella. I'm interested in learning about the essential biological ingredients used in cilia and ciliary arrays as well as how they are assembled by organisms to produce desired effects at larger and larger scales. I am also interested in trying to develop physics models that could aid in understanding how certain variables affect the flow generated by ciliary arrays. In my free time, I like to listen to music, play guitar, and cook. I also love working on hobby electronics with my brother in Boston.
