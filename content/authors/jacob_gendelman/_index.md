I studied Biology at Amherst College, and have done research in a variety of fields, including atomic physics, plant physiology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology. For my senior thesis, I studied the mating system of a fungal wildflower pathogen, Microbotryum scorzonerae. I'm excited to work in the Living Patterns Lab because our work is all about tiny individual components coming together to form complex and beautiful phenomena! When I'm not in lab, I enjoy running, baking bread, gardening, and making art in various media.
