I am a MCB masterâ€™s student from Hopkinton Massachusetts.   I received my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Chinese language at Haverford College, where I completed a senior thesis on the genetic editing of ciliopathic mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.    My main experiments for this project involved using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to restore motility to a paralyzed-flagella strain, but when completing background research I found myself fascinated with the mechanisms behind ciliary function and the consequences of paralyzed-cilia mutations in different organisms. Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about anime, video games, costuming, running, and metal music.
